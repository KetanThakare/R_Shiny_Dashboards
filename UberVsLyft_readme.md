# R_Shiny_UberVsLyft
#### Interactive Visualization of Rides of Uber and Lyft from Phoenix Airport. 
([Here](https://ketanthakare.shinyapps.io/Shiny_UbervsLyft/) is the webapp.)

### Why have I done this project?
The project is done to show my proficiency in using R-packages 'Shiny' & 'ShinyDashboard' to build interactive WebApp and tell a story.<br> </br>
### What is this project?
It's a webapp which interactively visualizes Uber vs Lyft rides in Phoenix.<br></br>
#### Project shows proficiency in  
**This project will demonstrate knowledge of:**
 - Constructing a decent User Interface
 - Using reactive expressions, R script and Data to reflect changes as per user input 
 - Using plotly package to construct interactive charts
<br></br>   
### How the Project has been done?  
1. I have used UbervsLyft data available on Phoenix City website and then created new files containing derived variables. If you want to take a look, [here](Data/) it is.
2. Then I spent a considerable time building the UI.
3. Finally coded the server part and app was ready.

You need to have an R environment (I used [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) with shiny & shinydasboard package installed on it.
<br></br>
### Walkthrough on using files to run this project on your terminal.
- Clone or download this repository on your terminal
- Ensure that dependencies like shiny, shinythemes, shinywidgets are installed (or install using install.package('dependency_name')).
- This [app.R](app.R) is the R file that should be loaded onto the IDE.
- Run the app using RunApp button which appears on  top-right corner of the window (or ctrl+Enter/cmd+Enter) would do the trick.
