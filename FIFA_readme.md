# FIFA viz
#### A Shiny WebApp

### Why have I done this project?
The project is done to show my elementary proficiency in using R-packages 'Shiny' & 'ShinyDashboard' to build WebApp and tell my story.<br></br>
### What is this project?
It's a webapp which gives information and some statistics of previous FIFA worldcups. There are two versions of webapp - one is done just using shiny while other one is dashboard version of same app.<br></br>
#### Project shows proficiency in  
**This project will demonstrate knowledge of:**
 - Constructing a decent User Interface
 - Using reactive expressions, R script and Data to reflect changes as per user input 
<br></br>   
### How the Project has been done?  
1. I have used FIFA WorldCup dataset available on Kaggle and modified it a bit to add some info and wikipedia links to that particular worldcup. If you want to take a look, [here](WorldCups.csv) it is.
2. Then I spent a considerable time building the UI.
3. Finally coded the server part and app was ready.

### What software do you need to run this project on your terminal?
You need to have an R environment (I used [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) with shiny & shinydasboard package installed on it.)
<br></br>
#### You can also run this without installing R. Just click [here](https://ketanthakare.shinyapps.io/Shiny_FIFA/) for webapp and [here](https://ketanthakare.shinyapps.io/Shiny_FIFA_DashboardVersion/) for dashboard version.<br></br>
### Walkthrough on using files to run this project on your terminal.
- Clone or download this repository on your terminal
- Ensure that dependencies like shiny, shinythemes, shinywidgets are installed (or install using install.package('dependency_name')).
- This [app.R](app.R) is the R file that should be loaded onto the IDE.
- Run the app using RunApp button which appears on  top-right corner of the window (or ctrl+Enter/cmd+Enter) would do the trick.
